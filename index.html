<h1>Welcome to my portifolio!</h1>

<p>My name is Laine Hernandez, in the picture below, I am with my terminal open and this was my second day of classes as a web developer student. On that day, I have learned how to download the extension 🧛🏻‍♂️ Dracula- I love to see colors and images everywhere so this extension is perfect to me! </p>
